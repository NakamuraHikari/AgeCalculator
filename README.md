# AgeCalculator

This is a file about how to use my very smart age calculator

You need a IDE that supports c++ language like: Dev c++, Code Blocks, Visual Studio code, Visual Studio, etc...

First: Retype all the code in the main.cpp file into your IDE (or copy it over).
Second: Launch that code

That's all you need to do. It's nothing !!!
